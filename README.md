# md_website_builder
Boilerplate code to build book-like website from markdown files.

- Place `deploy.pages.yaml` in a .github/workflows folder
- Run `build_site.py` to generate the index.html
- Ensure `index.html` is in the `docs` folder with a subfolder called `figures`
- Ensure settings/pages is set to build from the docs folder of the rep
- Now you will have a static website hosted on github.io!
